NodeJS Program to surf the web in your terminal
</p>

Here is almost nothing yet and I am not sure if this will work as expected...

For now there is **no** deployment version. <br>
If you still want to build and execute the programm, follow these steps:

0. Open up your terminal (and navigate somewhere you want to download the repository to) <br><br>
1. Make sure you have nodejs installed. Test by  entering <br>
$ `node -v` <br>
If this returns a version number, NodeJS is installed. **If not**, get NodeJS <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a>. <br><br>
2. Clone the repository and navigate to it. You can either download it <a href="https://github.com/NLDev/Terminal-Browser/archive/master.zip">here</a> or if you have Git installed, type <br>
$ `git clone https://github.com/NLDev/Terminal-Browser.git && cd Terminal-Browser` <br><br>
3. Install all dependencies <br>
$ `npm install` <br><br>
4. Wait for it to finish. After installation is done, run the programm with <br>
$ `npm start` <br><br>
5. **Optional**: You can also start the program in debugging mode by entering <br>
$ `npm test`
